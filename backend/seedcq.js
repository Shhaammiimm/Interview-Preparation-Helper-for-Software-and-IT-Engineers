  // ===== OOP Questions  =====
  {
    question: "What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?",
    answer: "OOP is a programming paradigm that organizes software around objects. Objects represent real-world entities with attributes (data) and behaviors (methods). It improves modularity, reusability, and maintainability by modeling problems closer to real-world concepts.",
    category: "OOP"
  },
  {
    question: "What are the four pillars of OOP?",
    answer: "The four main principles are: Encapsulation (binding data and methods together), Abstraction (hiding internal details and showing only essentials), Inheritance (reusing and extending existing code), and Polymorphism (same interface, different implementations).",
    category: "OOP"
  },
  {
    question: "What is a class?",
    answer: "A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines variables (attributes) and functions (methods) that describe the common properties and behaviors of objects created from it.",
    category: "OOP"
  },
  {
    question: "What is an object?",
    answer: "An object is an instance of a class. It occupies memory and contains actual values for the attributes defined in its class along with the ability to call its methods.",
    category: "OOP"
  },
  {
    question: "Difference between class and object?",
    answer: "A class is only a logical structure or definition, while an object is a real instance created from that class at runtime. For example, 'Car' is a class, but 'Toyota Corolla' is an object.",
    category: "OOP"
  },
  {
    question: "What is encapsulation?",
    answer: "Encapsulation means wrapping data (variables) and code (methods) into a single unit and restricting direct access to internal details. It is usually achieved using access modifiers like private, public, or protected.",
    category: "OOP"
  },
  {
    question: "What is abstraction?",
    answer: "Abstraction is the process of hiding implementation details and exposing only the essential features of an object. For example, a car’s driver uses the steering wheel without needing to know how the steering mechanism internally works.",
    category: "OOP"
  },
  {
    question: "What is inheritance?",
    answer: "Inheritance allows a class (child/derived class) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (parent/base class). It promotes code reuse and establishes an 'is-a' relationship between classes.",
    category: "OOP"
  },
  {
    question: "What is polymorphism?",
    answer: "Polymorphism allows one interface to be used for different underlying forms. It can be compile-time (method overloading) or runtime (method overriding). Example: a function 'area()' behaving differently for Circle and Rectangle objects.",
    category: "OOP"
  },
  {
    question: "Difference between abstraction and encapsulation?",
    answer: "Abstraction focuses on exposing only relevant features while hiding unnecessary details (design-level). Encapsulation focuses on protecting object state by restricting direct access to data (implementation-level).",
    category: "OOP"
  },
  {
    question: "What is method overloading?",
    answer: "Method overloading allows multiple methods in the same class with the same name but different parameter lists. It is resolved at compile time and improves code readability.",
    category: "OOP"
  },
  {
    question: "What is method overriding?",
    answer: "Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides a new implementation for a method already defined in its superclass. It is resolved at runtime and supports dynamic polymorphism.",
    category: "OOP"
  },
  {
    question: "What are constructors?",
    answer: "Constructors are special methods automatically invoked when an object is created. They initialize the object’s attributes and can be overloaded for flexibility.",
    category: "OOP"
  },
  {
    question: "What is a destructor?",
    answer: "A destructor is a method automatically invoked when an object is destroyed. It is used to release resources such as memory or file handles. Example: '~ClassName()' in C++.",
    category: "OOP"
  },
  {
    question: "What are access modifiers?",
    answer: "Access modifiers define the scope of variables and methods: Public (accessible everywhere), Private (only inside class), Protected (within class and subclasses).",
    category: "OOP"
  },
  {
    question: "What is an abstract class?",
    answer: "An abstract class cannot be instantiated directly and may contain abstract methods (without implementation). Subclasses must implement the abstract methods. It allows defining a common contract.",
    category: "OOP"
  },
  {
    question: "What is an interface?",
    answer: "An interface is a contract that defines a set of methods a class must implement. It supports multiple inheritance and helps achieve abstraction and loose coupling.",
    category: "OOP"
  },
  {
    question: "Difference between abstract class and interface?",
    answer: "Abstract classes can have both abstract and concrete methods, while interfaces only declare method signatures (in most languages). A class can inherit one abstract class but implement multiple interfaces.",
    category: "OOP"
  },
  {
    question: "What is multiple inheritance?",
    answer: "Multiple inheritance is when a class can inherit from more than one class. It is supported in C++ but not in Java (to avoid ambiguity). Java achieves similar behavior using interfaces.",
    category: "OOP"
  },
  {
    question: "What is diamond problem?",
    answer: "The diamond problem occurs in multiple inheritance when two parent classes of a child class have the same method, causing ambiguity about which method to inherit. C++ solves it using virtual inheritance.",
    category: "OOP"
  },
  {
    question: "What are static methods?",
    answer: "Static methods belong to the class rather than any instance. They can be called without creating an object but cannot access instance variables directly.",
    category: "OOP"
  },
  {
    question: "Static vs instance methods?",
    answer: "Static methods are tied to the class and shared across all objects, while instance methods are tied to a specific object and can access instance-specific data.",
    category: "OOP"
  },
  {
    question: "What is 'this' keyword?",
    answer: "‘this’ is a reference to the current object instance. It is used to distinguish instance variables from parameters with the same name or to pass the current object.",
    category: "OOP"
  },
  {
    question: "Shallow copy vs deep copy?",
    answer: "Shallow copy copies only object references (two objects share same memory). Deep copy duplicates the object and all its referenced data, creating a fully independent clone.",
    category: "OOP"
  },
  {
    question: "What is composition?",
    answer: "Composition is a 'has-a' relationship where one class contains an object of another class. Example: A Car 'has-a' Engine. It is preferred over inheritance due to better flexibility.",
    category: "OOP"
  },
  {
    question: "Difference between inheritance and composition?",
    answer: "Inheritance is an 'is-a' relationship (Dog is an Animal). Composition is a 'has-a' relationship (Car has an Engine). Composition avoids tight coupling and is more flexible.",
    category: "OOP"
  },
  {
    question: "Compile-time vs runtime polymorphism?",
    answer: "Compile-time polymorphism (method overloading) is resolved by the compiler. Runtime polymorphism (method overriding) is resolved during execution using dynamic dispatch.",
    category: "OOP"
  },
  {
    question: "What is SOLID in OOP?",
    answer: "SOLID stands for 5 design principles: Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion. These principles improve design quality and maintainability.",
    category: "OOP"
  },
  {
    question: "Explain Single Responsibility Principle.",
    answer: "A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should do only one job. This makes the class more focused and easier to maintain.",
    category: "OOP"
  },
  {
    question: "Explain Open/Closed Principle.",
    answer: "Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. You should be able to add new functionality without changing existing code.",
    category: "OOP"
  },
  {
    question: "Explain Liskov Substitution Principle.",
    answer: "Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without breaking functionality. Subclasses should follow the contract of their parent class.",
    category: "OOP"
  },
  {
    question: "Explain Interface Segregation Principle.",
    answer: "Clients should not be forced to depend on methods they do not use. Instead of one large interface, create multiple small, specific interfaces.",
    category: "OOP"
  },
  {
    question: "Explain Dependency Inversion Principle.",
    answer: "High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. This reduces coupling and increases flexibility.",
    category: "OOP"
  },
  {
    question: "What are design patterns in OOP?",
    answer: "Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems in software design. Examples include Singleton, Factory, Observer, and Decorator patterns.",
    category: "OOP"
  },
  {
    question: "What is Singleton pattern?",
    answer: "Singleton ensures that only one instance of a class exists and provides global access to it. It is often used for logging, configuration, or database connections.",
    category: "OOP"
  },
  {
    question: "What is Factory pattern?",
    answer: "Factory provides an interface to create objects without specifying the exact class. It abstracts the object creation process, improving flexibility.",
    category: "OOP"
  },
  {
    question: "What is Builder pattern?",
    answer: "Builder separates the construction of a complex object from its representation. It allows step-by-step creation of objects with different configurations.",
    category: "OOP"
  },
  {
    question: "What is Decorator pattern?",
    answer: "Decorator allows behavior to be added to an object dynamically without altering its structure. Example: adding scrollbars to a window class at runtime.",
    category: "OOP"
  },
  {
    question: "What is Observer pattern?",
    answer: "Observer defines a one-to-many dependency so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified automatically. Example: Event listeners.",
    category: "OOP"
  },
  {
    question: "Why prefer composition over inheritance?",
    answer: "Composition provides more flexibility and reduces coupling. Inheritance tightly binds child to parent, whereas composition allows objects to change behavior at runtime.",
    category: "OOP"
  },
  {
    question: "What is information hiding?",
    answer: "Information hiding is restricting access to internal details of a class and exposing only necessary parts. It improves security and reduces system complexity.",
    category: "OOP"
  },
  {
    question: "What is dynamic dispatch?",
    answer: "Dynamic dispatch is the process of selecting which implementation of a polymorphic method will be executed at runtime based on the object’s actual type.",
    category: "OOP"
  },
  {
    question: "What is prototype-based OOP?",
    answer: "In prototype-based OOP (like JavaScript), objects are created by cloning existing objects (prototypes) instead of defining classes. It promotes flexibility.",
    category: "OOP"
  },
  {
    question: "What is an immutable object?",
    answer: "Immutable objects are objects whose state cannot change after creation. They simplify debugging and ensure thread safety. Example: String in Java.",
    category: "OOP"
  },
  {
    question: "What is GRASP in OOP?",
    answer: "GRASP (General Responsibility Assignment Software Patterns) provides guidelines for assigning responsibilities in OOP, such as Information Expert, Low Coupling, High Cohesion, and Controller.",
    category: "OOP"
  },
  {
    question: "What is Information Expert (GRASP)?",
    answer: "Information Expert principle states that responsibility should be assigned to the class that has the necessary information to fulfill it.",
    category: "OOP"
  },
  {
    question: "What is Low Coupling, High Cohesion?",
    answer: "Low coupling reduces dependencies between classes. High cohesion ensures that a class has a well-defined responsibility. Both improve modularity and maintainability.",
    category: "OOP"
  },
  {
    question: "What is Prototype design pattern?",
    answer: "Prototype pattern allows creating new objects by cloning an existing instance. It avoids costly object creation and is useful for objects with complex setup.",
